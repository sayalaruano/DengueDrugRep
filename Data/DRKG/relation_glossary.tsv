Relation-name	Data-source	Connected entity-types	Interaction-type	Description	Reference for the description
DGIDB::ACTIVATOR::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	activation	An activator interaction is when a drug activates a biological response from a target, although the mechanism by which it does so may not be understood.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::AGONIST::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	agonism	An agonist interaction occurs when a drug binds to a target receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	allosteric modulation	An allosteric modulator interaction occurs when drugs exert their effects on their protein targets via a different binding site than the natural (orthosteric) ligand site.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::ANTAGONIST::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	antagonism	An antagonist interaction occurs when a drug blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a target receptor.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::ANTIBODY::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	antibody	An antibody interaction occurs when an antibody drug specifically binds the target molecule.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::BINDER::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	binding	A binder interaction has drugs physically binding to their target.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::BLOCKER::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	blocking	Antagonist interactions are sometimes referred to as blocker interactions; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::CHANNEL BLOCKER::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	channel blocking		http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::INHIBITOR::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	inhibition	In inhibitor interactions, the drug binds to a target and decreases its expression or activity. Most interactions of this class are enzyme inhibitors, which bind an enzyme to reduce enzyme activity.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::MODULATOR::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	modulation	In modulator interactions, the drug regulates or changes the activity of its target. In contrast to allosteric modulators, this interaction type may not involve any direct binding to the target.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::OTHER::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	other	This is a label given by the reporting source to an interaction that doesn't belong to other interaction types, as defined by the reporting source.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::PARTIAL AGONIST::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	partial agonism	In a partial antagonist interaction, a drug will only partially reduce the amplitude of a functional response at its target receptor, as compared to the reduction of response by a full antagonist.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DGIDB::POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR::Gene:Compound	DGIDB	Compound:Gene	positive allosteric modulation	In a positive allosteric modulator interaction, the drug increases activity of the target enzyme.	http://www.dgidb.org/getting_started
DRUGBANK::carrier::Compound:Gene	DRUGBANK	Compound:Gene	carrier	Gene acts as a carrier which binds to a drug and modifies its pharmacokinetics.	https://dev.drugbankplus.com/guides/terms/carrier
DRUGBANK::ddi-interactor-in::Compound:Compound	DRUGBANK	Compound:Compound	drug-drug interaction	In DrugBank, this relation refers to a change in a drug's effect on the body when the drug is taken with other drugs.	https://dev.drugbankplus.com/guides/terms/drug-interaction
DRUGBANK::enzyme::Compound:Gene	DRUGBANK	Compound:Gene	enzyme	Gene acts as an enzyme that facilitates the occurrence of a metabolic reaction by interacting with and transforming a drug or chemical to one or more specific metabolites.	https://dev.drugbankplus.com/guides/terms/enzyme
DRUGBANK::target::Compound:Gene	DRUGBANK	Compound:Gene	target	The drug binds or otherwise interacts with the gene, resulting in an alteration of the normal function of the bound molecule and desirable therapeutic effects or unwanted adverse effects.	https://dev.drugbankplus.com/guides/terms/target
DRUGBANK::x-atc::Compound:Atc	DRUGBANK	ATC:Compound	Compound belongs to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code.	We extend the hierarchical ATC classification information of drugs from their corresponding ATC codes and connect entities representing each level of ATC into certain drugs.	
DRUGBANK::treats::Compound:Disease	DRUGBANK	Compound:Disease	Compound treats the disease	We extract  the  associated  conditions  related  to  compound entities in the drugbank.
